function cleanTemplate(obj)
  % CLEANTEMPLATE  See infoTemplate
  
  % Place any code that you want to execute befor deleting the object or during
  % cleanup here. 
  
  % NOTE: If you are debugging this method when an object is being
  % deleted, the command window will not be able to show the contents of the
  % object (it shows: "Deleted object"). However, the object is actually NOT
  % deleted yet and the individual properties of the objects are still
  % accessible. This is the result of Matlab setting the isvalid property to
  % false before this function is executed.
